# PolyScript Technical Specification

## 1. Introduction
PolyScript is designed as a multi-language platform where different programming languages can interact seamlessly. Below are the core principles and architecture details.

## 2. Core Architecture
### 2.1 Language Modules
Each supported language (Python, Rust, etc.) is encapsulated in its own module, allowing them to communicate through a shared intermediary layer.

*Languages currently supported*:
- Python
- Rust
- JavaScript

Future Integrations: Placeholder for new languages such as Elixir, Solidity.

### 2.2 AI-Assisted Development
PolyScript includes a built-in AI assistant that helps with:
- Code generation
- Optimizations
- Debugging

Planned AI Features: Add code transformation (convert Python to Rust, etc.).

### 2.3 Distributed and Parallel Computing
PolyScript's distributed framework enables developers to offload tasks to a network of machines or leverage cloud computing resources.

**Current State**: Basic distributed task execution.
**Planned**: Add quantum computing integration.

## 3. Syntax and Interoperability
PolyScript uses a unified syntax to allow easy communication between different language blocks.
Example:
```polyscript
module python {
    def py_func():
        return "Hello from Python"
}

module rust {
    fn rust_func() -> String {
        "Hello from Rust".to_string()
    }
}

let result_py = python.py_func();
let result_rust = rust.rust_func();
